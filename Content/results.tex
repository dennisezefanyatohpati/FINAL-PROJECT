\section{2 Dimensional Analysis}
This section will discuss the trend and effect of various undertray variables in 2 dimension. The variables tested consist of inlet angle, outlet angle, \& ground clearance which the optimised value will be used for 3 dimensional undertray analysis. The 2D analysis will consist of Enclosed flow analysis which use the Venturi-tube like geometry to simulate the flow of the undertray, and open-flow analysis which use the bluff body to simulate the flow behaviour and interaction between undertray and the bluff body.

\section{Sustainability}

\noindent Sustainability has become a fundamental consideration of production and design in most of industries \cite{Gates2021HowDisaster}. United Nations (UN) has created 17 goals of sustainable development which becoming the pillar and blueprint to achieve better future of humankind \cite{THEDevelopmentb}. This section will explain the aspect and impact of this project in response to the United Nations 17 sustainable development goal. There are two goals which align with this project: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure and Responsible Consumption and Production. It is clear that developing a new design such as an undertray used to generate significant amount of waste to physically get tested. By utilising Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), material consumption and production on prototyping can be reduced significantly to zero. The application of this method promotes sustainable industrialisation, foster innovation, and production which follows point 9 and 12 of Sustainable Development Goal.

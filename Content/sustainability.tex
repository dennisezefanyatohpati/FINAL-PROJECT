\section{Sustainability}

\noindent Sustainability has become a fundamental consideration of production and design in most industries \cite{Gates2021HowDisaster}. United Nations (UN) has created 17 goals of sustainable development, which became the pillar and blueprint to achieve a better future for humankind \cite{UNITEDNATIONS}. This section will explain the aspect and impact of this project in response to the United Nations 17 sustainable development goal. Two goals align with this project: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure and Responsible Consumption and Production. It is clear that developing a new design such as an undertray used to generate a significant amount of waste to get tested physically. By utilising Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), material consumption and production on the prototyping stage can be reduced significantly to zero. This application promotes sustainable industrialisation, fosters innovation, and production, which follows point 9 and 12 of the Sustainable Development Goal.

\textit{Research of an undertray device in the high-speed racing industry is still privilege information; this indicated by the lack of forthcoming research paper in the field. In this paper, downforce and drag of an undertray in 2 dimensional and three dimensional were investigated by employing the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. The analyses consist of 2D enclosed, 2D open-flow, 3D open-flow, and undertray prototypes to gain a fundamental understanding of the effect of undertray's flow features and performance behaviour in diverse geometrical setup. Two-dimensional simulation decided to be not optimal for undertray analysis as it does not properly capture the flow features in a Three-dimensional manner. The three-dimensional analysis has also shown the importance of strategy and management of effective flow control using an optimised vortex generator to maintain flow attachment on the undertray's wall and generate stable vortices to exploit the flow feature, improving the downforce and reducing drag. The final undertray design geometry was based on the previous analysis; the final result indicates 678.5\% improvement in downforce and 13\% reduction in drag at 40 $km/h$. Further research in flow features such as vortex generation and its effect on the undertray overall performance is required to utilise the potential of an undertray performance fully.}
